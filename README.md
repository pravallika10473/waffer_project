# AdaBalGAN: An Improved Generative Adversarial Network With Imbalanced Learning for Wafer Defective Pattern Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of the paper *AdaBalGAN: An Improved Generative Adversarial Network With Imbalanced Learning for Wafer Defective Pattern Recognition*. The project is aimed at recognizing wafer defective patterns using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with an emphasis on imbalanced learning. This particular implementation is data augumentation part of the paper.

## Setup

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

The scripts in this repository are designed to be run on a server such as CHPC (Center for High-Performance Computing). SLURM scripts for each of the main files are located in the `slurm/` folder. Ensure that you adjust the paths in the SLURM scripts according to your setup.

### Steps to Run

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   Run `data_preprocessing.py` to clean the data and extract the training and testing sets:
   ```bash
   sbatch slurm/data_preprocessing.slurm
   ```

2. **Training AdaBalGAN**:  
   Run `ccgan.py` to train the AdaBalGAN model and generate results as outlined in the paper:
   ```bash
   sbatch slurm/ccgan.slurm
   ```

### SLURM Scripts

Each script has a corresponding SLURM job script located in the `slurm/` folder. Adjust the file paths in the SLURM scripts to match your environment.

- For `data_preprocessing.py`:  
  Use the SLURM script `slurm/data_preprocessing.slurm`.
  
- For `ccgan.py`:  
  Use the SLURM script `slurm/ccgan.slurm`.

## Repository Link

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pravallika10473/waffer_project.git
```

## Results

The results generated by the AdaBalGAN model are available in the `AdablGAN_results.zip` file. You can find more details about the results in the paper.

## Notes

Make sure to adjust the paths in the SLURM scripts based on your system configuration.
